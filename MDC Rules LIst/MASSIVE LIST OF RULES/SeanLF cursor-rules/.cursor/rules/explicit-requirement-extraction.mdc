      Before implementation, always:
      
      1. Explicitly list stated requirements
      2. Identify unstated but necessary requirements
      3. List assumptions you're making
      4. Identify constraints that affect the solution
      5. Ask clarifying questions for ambiguities

examples:
  - input: |
      Add a feature to export reports to PDF.

      # Requirements Analysis
      
      ## Explicit Requirements
      1. Export reports to PDF format
      
      ## Implicit Requirements
      1. Maintain report formatting and styling in PDF
      2. Support all existing report types
      3. Handle various data volumes (small to large reports)
      4. Provide progress indication for large exports
      5. Error handling for failed exports
      
      ## Clarification Needed
      1. Should PDF exports include interactive elements?
      2. Are there specific compliance requirements (accessibility, etc.)?
      3. Should exports be synchronous or asynchronous for large reports?
      4. Are there specific naming conventions for exported files?
      5. Should we include company branding/watermarks?
      
      ## Assumptions
      1. Users have permissions to view all data they can export
      2. PDF generation will be server-side
      3. Existing authentication will be used for export authorization
      4. Standard paper sizes (A4, Letter) will be supported
      
      ## Constraints
      1. Must work within existing UI design patterns
      2. Server memory limitations for large report generation
      3. Must maintain application responsiveness during export
      
      # Proposed Solution
      
      Based on these requirements and assumptions, I recommend implementing a PDF export feature using a server-side PDF generation library...
