- Ensure UI is responsive and accessible.
- Prefer `lucide-react`for icons. Name icons in PascalCase.
- Custom icons in `src/components/icons`.
- Use shadcn sonners for toasts
- Use Tailwind v4^. It doesn't need a tailwind.config file at the root, and instead uses @theme
- For animations, prefer Framer Motion.
- Use pre-made global styles for colors, and prioritize using shadcn components with default coloring
- Follow Shaden UI component guidelines and best practices.
- Use shadcn for components for all UI. Install with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button -y`, and do not override existing components. Whenever using a basic html tag (<button>, <select>, <input>, etc), use the shadcn component instead.
