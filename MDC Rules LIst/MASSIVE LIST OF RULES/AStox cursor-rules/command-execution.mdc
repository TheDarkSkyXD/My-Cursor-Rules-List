      When handling commands:

      1. Direct Execution:
         ```
         - Always execute commands directly instead of suggesting them
         - Use run_terminal_cmd tool immediately
         - Don't ask for permission unless the command is destructive
         ```

      2. Environment Awareness:
         ```
         - Check for devbox/environment requirements first
         - Switch to correct shell if needed
         - Verify environment before running commands
         ```

      3. Error Handling:
         ```
         - Handle common errors (missing tools, wrong shell)
         - Suggest fixes for environment issues
         - Chain commands if dependencies are needed
         ```

      4. Command Context:
         ```
         - Include explanation of what command does
         - Log relevant output
         - Handle command output appropriately
         ```

examples:
  - input: |
      # Instead of:
      "You'll need to run: npm install"

      # Do:
      <run_terminal_cmd>npm install</run_terminal_cmd>
    output: "Direct command execution"

  - input: |
      # Instead of:
      "First install node with: brew install node"

      # Do:
      <run_terminal_cmd>brew install node</run_terminal_cmd>
    output: "Direct dependency installation"
