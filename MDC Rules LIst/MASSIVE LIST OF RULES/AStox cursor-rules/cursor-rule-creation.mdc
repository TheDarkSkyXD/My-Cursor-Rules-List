# Cursor Rules Creation

Rule for creating Cursor rule files by first creating in root directory, then moving to .cursor/rules.

<rule>
name: cursor_rule_creation
description: Standards for creating Cursor rule files to avoid content loss
filters:
  - type: event
    pattern: "file_create"
  - type: content
    pattern: "cursor.*rule"
  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "\\.mdc$"

- type: suggest
  message: |
  When creating new Cursor rules:

  1. Use Root Directory First:

     ```
     - Create the file in the root directory with .md extension
     - Then move the file to .cursor/rules and rename to .mdc
     - Example: mv rule-name.md .cursor/rules/rule-name.mdc
     ```

  2. File Structure:

     ```
     - Always include the frontmatter with description
     - Set globs: * by default unless rule is specific to certain file types
     - Follow the standard rule format with <rule> tags
     - Include name, description, filters, actions, examples, and metadata
     ```

  3. Glob Patterns:

     ```
     - Use globs: * for rules that apply to all files
     - Use specific patterns for targeted rules (e.g., "*.sol" for Solidity)
     - Multiple patterns can be specified as a list: ["*.sol", "*.js"]
     - Be as specific as possible to avoid unnecessary rule application
     ```

  4. Verification:

     ```
     - After moving the file, verify its contents
     - Check the file size or line count
     - Ensure the file has the expected content
     ```

  5. Never Use:
     ```
     - Direct creation of .mdc files in .cursor/rules directory
     - Always create in root first, then move to .cursor/rules
     ```

  # Good: Root directory first with proper glob

  description: My general rule
  globs: "\*"
  alwaysApply: false

  ***

  # My Rule

    <rule>
    ...
    </rule>
  output: "Rule file with proper glob pattern"

- input: |

  # Good: Specific glob for targeted rule

  ***

  description: Solidity-specific rule
  globs: "\*.sol"
  alwaysApply: false

  ***

  # Solidity Rule

    <rule>
    ...
    </rule>
  output: "Rule file with specific glob pattern"

- input: |
  # Bad: Missing glob pattern
  ***
  description: My rule
  globs:

  output: "Missing default glob pattern"
