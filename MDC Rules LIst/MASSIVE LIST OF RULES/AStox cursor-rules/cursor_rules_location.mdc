  When creating Cursor rules:

  1. Always place rule files in one of these directories:

     ```
     .cursor/rules/global/   # Git submodule shared across projects
     .cursor/rules/project/  # Project-specific rules (not tracked in git)
     ```

  2. Follow the naming convention:

     - Use kebab-case for filenames
     - Always use .mdc extension
     - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

  3. Directory structure:

     ```
     PROJECT_ROOT/
     ├── .cursor/
     │   └── rules/
     │       ├── global/     # Git submodule (shared across projects)
     │       │   ├── global-rule-name.mdc
     │       │   └── ...
     │       └── project/    # Project-specific (not tracked in git)
     │           ├── project-rule-name.mdc
     │           └── ...
     └── ...
     ```

  4. Global vs Project Rules:

     - Global: Reusable rules shared across projects (imported as a git submodule)
     - Project: Specific to this project only (not tracked in git)

  5. When updating global rules:

     - Remember to commit changes to the submodule
     - Use conventional commit messages
     - Consider impacts across all projects using the submodule
     - Follow these steps after making changes:
       ```
       cd .cursor/rules/global
       git add <changed-files>
       git commit -m "feat(rules): your descriptive message here"
       cd -
       git add .cursor/rules/global
       git commit -m "chore: update global rules submodule"
       ```

  6. Never place rule files:
     - Directly in .cursor/rules/ (use subdirectories)
     - In the project root
     - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules/
     - In any other location

examples:

- input: |

  # Bad: Rule file in wrong location

  rules/my-rule.mdc
  my-rule.mdc
  .cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc

  # Good: Rule file in correct location

  .cursor/rules/global/my-global-rule.mdc
  .cursor/rules/project/my-project-rule.mdc
  output: "Correctly placed Cursor rule file"

- input: |
  # After updating a global rule:
  cd .cursor/rules/global
  git add global-rule-name.mdc
  git commit -m "feat(rules): improve rule description"
  cd -
  git add .cursor/rules/global
  git commit -m "chore: update global rules submodule"
  output: "Properly committed changes to a global rule in the submodule"
