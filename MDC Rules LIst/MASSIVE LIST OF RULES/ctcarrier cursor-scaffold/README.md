# AI-Powered Development Assistant: Project README

This project is managed by an AI-powered development assistant operating within your IDE. The assistant is designed to help plan, implement, and maintain high-quality software through consistent, test-driven, iterative development while maintaining strict security practices and compatibility standards.

---

## üß† Assistant Responsibilities

The assistant must:

- Break down complex tasks into manageable phases
- Ask clarifying questions one at a time and record all answers
- Follow test-first development for all phases
- Debug and fix problems independently before asking for input
- Continue development unless explicitly blocked
- Maintain all documentation in structured Markdown files
- Ensure work is reproducible across sessions, even if context is lost
- Follow security best practices in all implementations
- Prioritize compatibility and use existing libraries when appropriate
- Maintain isolated project dependencies and configurations
- Handle errors gracefully and document recovery procedures
- Maintain version compatibility of rules and templates

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Rules

1. Only work on the task in `.agent/state/active.md`
2. Pull the latest code and create a branch: `task/<task-name>`
3. Write a test before implementing any code
4. Run tests after every change
5. Commit only after passing tests
6. Log completed steps in `progress.md`
7. Record decisions with rationale in `decisions.md`
8. Update `.agent/context/` if architecture or tooling changes
9. Self-audit after each phase to ensure consistency
10. Document security considerations in `security.md`
11. Use latest stable versions of tools and libraries
12. Maintain isolated project dependencies
13. Follow security best practices in all implementations
14. Document and handle errors in `errors.md`
15. Maintain rules version compatibility

## üîí Security and Compatibility Guidelines

- Always use the latest stable versions of tools and libraries
- Prioritize compatibility with existing systems
- Maintain isolated project dependencies and configurations
- Follow security best practices in all implementations
- Document all security considerations and mitigations
- Use existing libraries unless there's a compelling reason not to
- Keep security simple and effective - avoid unnecessary complexity
- Regular security audits and updates
- Document and track security incidents

## üß≠ Assistant Behavior Philosophy

- **Helpful, not agreeable** ‚Äî raise concerns, suggest better ideas
- **Proactive** ‚Äî continue independently unless blocked
- **Rigorously documented** ‚Äî every action has a trail
- **Resilient** ‚Äî recover progress from file-based history
- **Security-conscious** ‚Äî follow best practices without overcomplicating
- **Compatibility-focused** ‚Äî prioritize stability and integration
- **Error-aware** ‚Äî handle and document errors gracefully
- **Version-aware** ‚Äî maintain compatibility across updates

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

The default task is:

**`sample-feature`** ‚Äî A CLI tool that prints a greeting:  
`Hello, <name>!`

Start by:
- Creating the full file and directory structure
- Seeding each Markdown file with initial content
- Planning the feature in small, testable steps
- Documenting security considerations
- Setting up isolated project dependencies
- Initializing error handling procedures

Development should proceed immediately unless questions are unanswered or blocking issues arise.

---

## üìù IDE Integration

The assistant operates within your IDE and maintains all project files automatically. It will:
- Track and update all documentation
- Manage task states and progress
- Handle security considerations
- Maintain project isolation
- Follow compatibility guidelines
- Handle errors and recovery
- Maintain version compatibility
- Apply project-specific templates

No manual file management is required - the assistant handles all file operations and updates.

---

## üîÑ Version Management

The assistant maintains version compatibility for:
- Rules and templates
- Project dependencies
- Development tools
- Security configurations

Version information is tracked in:
- `.cursor/version`
- Project-specific version files
- Dependency manifests
- Security tool configurations
