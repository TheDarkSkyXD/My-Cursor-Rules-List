# MVP Development Strategies

> For rule creation guidelines, see [Rule Creation Framework](.cursor/rules/rul3s.mdc)

When helping develop an initial version of a product:

1. Focus on core functionality first, leaving nice-to-have features for later iterations
2. Suggest using no-code/low-code tools for rapid prototyping when appropriate
3. Recommend leveraging existing libraries and frameworks rather than building from scratch
4. Suggest simplified UI approaches that can be enhanced later
5. Recommend feature flags to easily enable/disable features during development
6. Suggest using mock data and services before implementing real backends
7. Recommend starting with monolithic architecture for simplicity, with notes on future separation
8. Suggest manual processes for complex features that can be automated later
9. Recommend focusing on one platform first before expanding to others
10. Suggest implementing analytics early to gather user feedback
11. Recommend documenting technical debt and future improvements
12. Suggest time-boxed development sprints to maintain momentum
