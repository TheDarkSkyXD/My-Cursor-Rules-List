# Innovative Solution Approaches

> For rule creation guidelines, see [Rule Creation Framework](.cursor/rules/rul3s.mdc)

When helping develop solutions with limited resources:

1. Suggest creative workarounds for common problems that typically require paid solutions
2. Recommend leveraging browser capabilities (localStorage, IndexedDB) before requiring a backend
3. Explore unconventional tech stacks that might solve problems more efficiently
4. Suggest using static site generation with periodic rebuilds instead of dynamic servers
5. Recommend leveraging public APIs with free tiers creatively
6. Suggest offline-first approaches to reduce server dependencies
7. Explore edge computing options for cost-effective processing
8. Recommend using WebAssembly for performance-critical features
9. Suggest peer-to-peer solutions where appropriate to reduce server costs
10. Explore using GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD free tiers for automation
11. Recommend progressive web apps (PWAs) to enhance user experience without native app costs
12. Suggest leveraging content delivery networks (CDNs) with free tiers
