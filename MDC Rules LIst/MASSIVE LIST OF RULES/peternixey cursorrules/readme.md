# My Cursor Rules Collection

This is my personal collection of rules and guidelines that I use with the Cursor IDE's AI assistant. These rules help maintain consistency in my projects and guide the AI in following my preferred development practices.

## What's Inside

Each `.mdc` file contains specific guidelines for different aspects of development:

### Core Guidelines
- `read_this_first.mdc` - Start here! Overview of how these rules work together
- `code_style_rules.mdc` - My preferred code style and architecture approaches
- `docs_and_commenting.mdc` - How I like my code documented

### Development Workflow
- `debugging_strategies.mdc` - My systematic approach to debugging
- `testing_rules.mdc` - Testing principles and patterns I follow
- `create_pr_cover_note.mdc` - Template and guidelines for PR descriptions

### Infrastructure
- `docker_ci_rules.mdc` - Docker and CI configuration preferences
- `rules_meta.mdc` - How to maintain and update these rules

### Framework-Specific
- `angular_control_flow.mdc` - Guidelines for Angular 17+ control flow syntax

## Using These Rules

1. Clone this repo
2. Copy the rules to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory
3. The AI assistant will automatically incorporate these guidelines in your conversations

## Why Share These?

I'm sharing these rules because they've helped me maintain consistency across my projects. Feel free to use them as inspiration for your own rule set, or fork and modify them to match your preferences.
