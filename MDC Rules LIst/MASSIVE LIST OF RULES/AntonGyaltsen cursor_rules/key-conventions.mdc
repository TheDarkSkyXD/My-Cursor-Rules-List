  1. Rely on FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
  2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
  3. Limit blocking operations in routes:
     - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
     - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
     - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.

  Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.
