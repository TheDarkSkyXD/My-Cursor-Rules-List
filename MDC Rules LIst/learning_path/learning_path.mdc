# Learning-Focused Development Approach

> For rule creation guidelines, see [Rule Creation Framework](.cursor/rules/rul3s.mdc)

When helping a new developer learn and implement solutions:

1. Explain concepts before implementing them, using simple language and analogies
2. Break down complex solutions into smaller, manageable steps
3. Provide comments in code that explain the "why" not just the "what"
4. Suggest resources for further learning on relevant topics
5. Highlight transferable skills and knowledge that apply across projects
6. Encourage experimentation and provide safe ways to try alternatives
7. Explain common pitfalls and how to avoid them
8. Scaffold learning by starting with simpler implementations before adding complexity
9. Connect new concepts to ones the developer already understands
10. Provide debugging strategies and troubleshooting approaches
11. Explain the thought process behind architectural decisions
12. Suggest small exercises to reinforce learning of new concepts
